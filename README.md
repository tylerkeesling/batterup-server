# Batter Up: The app that tracks your stats

Batter Up is an web application for desktop and mobile that I designed and built for my softball team. Batter Up is a central team hub and enables the team/coach to set a roster and track hitting statistics over the course of a season.

This was my capstone project for the g55 Galvanize cohort in Denver - Platte.
